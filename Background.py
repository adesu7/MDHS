st.write("This is an experimental teaching tool. It has not been refined in detail and is prone to 'hallucinations' (providing false information). It's designed for fun and your personal interest but should not be treated as a reliable source of information. We're interested in experimenting with first-generation AI-based teaching tools in SSCS. Please note, this demo is designed to process a maximum of 20 interactions. Thank you for your understanding.")

You may consult your supervisor for advice and request for any relevant medical reports of the patient and they can provide access to you.")
